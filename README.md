# To-Do
 - I should probably sort the various file contents into a more readable form.

# Known Bugs
 - A Bug when going through towns. Harmless, although I can't isolate what is causing it. Something with Furniture generating somewhere it shouldn't. Seperate from the issue with furniture attemptiong to generate on open space.

# The Defrosting
Dark Skies Above was put into A seperate Repository after the Origianl Author ceased upkeep and its regualar maintainance became a drain on resources. As my first prioriy, I am trying to get this whole thing into an error-and-bug-free state. At the time of writing this is mostly done, see the To-Do Fixing point. I do plan on continuing the mod after that, this does however mean that the original authors ideas and Designs aren't necessarily representative of the direction this mod will go. I do however plan to keep most things that are in here, I have some nice ideas there.

# Dark Skies Above
A partial conversion mod for Cataclysm: DDA, taking inspiration from 'alien invasion' media to present a game of survival against an alien occupation force. WIP, but planned features include Quests, NPCs, Locations, and Enemies.

# Planned Features
In short, Dark Skies is supposed to be quite different to vanilla DDA, though not necessarily harder. 

 - Many more people were twisted into hostile mutants by alien bioweapons, now called Strays. They are slightly weaker than a vanilla zombie, but they come in larger groups and have a few nasty variants.
 - Many buildings were badly damaged during the Arrival and the ensuing conflict, destroying much of the supplies inside. 
 - Invasive alien species prowl the wilderness, some hostile.
 - WIP: Mutations and CBMs, among other sci-fi native to DDA, have been stripped out, with intent for similar tech to come from reverse engineering alien gear.
 - WIP: NPC missions, building up a resistance, working to secure small victories against the occupation forces.
 - WIP: Lots of 'dungeons' to explore and clever ways to strip down alien tech for parts to build tools, similar to Aftershock.

# Meta
I am doing this because I want to learn how cdda code works in an environment where I can afford major fuck-ups.
Dark Skies Above being a conversion mod means, that this mod won't work with most other mods. Likewise, tileset support is probably going to be difficult, I am not an artist and forays into the field have gone poorly. The best method so far would be to use looks_like.
